This project is part of a Udacity Landing Page Project. 

## Project Challenge
This project requires students to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Development
I used several ES6 methods and also JavaScript and browser and browser functions which are
only available in the latest modern browsers, e.g. `IntersectionObserver`.

Most of the behaviors are happened in the `~/script.js` and `styles.css`
